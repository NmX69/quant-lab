You are working on Quant Lab – a private, AI-assisted cryptocurrency quant research platform.

Live repository (source of truth – updates instantly when I save locally):

http://74.221.149.207

Your first action in this new chat:

1. Fetch and read the full project.txt from the root: project.txt

   This is the single source of truth for project state, current phase, and all rules.

2. Then perform a fresh scan of every .py and .json file in the entire repository (core/, strategies/, root, etc.).

3. Confirm you have fully understood:

   - Current phase and exact progress

   - Design principles

   - What is already implemented vs what is missing

   - The AI workflow (you generate clean git-style diffs → I apply → repo auto-updates)

Once done, reply:

“Repository synced. project.txt loaded. Full code scan complete.  Ready for today’s coding.”
